## Introduction
The Movie Recommendation System aims to provide personalized movie recommendations using various recommendation techniques. The project is based on the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset and involves:

1. Content-Based Filtering: Recommending movies similar to those a user has liked in the past based on movie attributes.
2. Collaborative Filtering: Recommending movies based on the preferences of similar users.
3. Hybrid Method: Combining both content-based and collaborative filtering to enhance recommendation accuracy.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository and click on the "Code" button to copy the URL.
   - Use the URL to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
   - Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   
     pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Download Datasets:**
   - Place the `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` files in the `data/` directory.

## Usage Guide
Here is how you can use different parts of the recommendation system:

1. **Content-Based Recommendation:**
   - Navigate to the directory.
   - Run the script or use the provided functions to get movie recommendations based on content similarity.

2. **Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Navigate to the directory.
   - Run the collaborative filtering script to get recommendations based on user similarity.

3. **Hybrid Recommendation:**
   - Navigate to the directory.
   - Use the hybrid recommendation script to get enhanced recommendations by combining both methods.

### Example Usage
To run the content-based recommendation system, use the following command:

python src/content_based/recommend.py --movie_id

Replace MOVIE_ID with the ID of the movie you want to get recommendations for.
